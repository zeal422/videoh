# Lessons

One entry per failure, wrong assumption, or defect found after a check had
passed. Appended by the implementation-discipline skill during a run; the
checklist itself stays short, this log grows.

Promotion is the point: an entry that stays here is a note; an entry promoted
into `SKILL.md` stops the next run from repeating it.

Format:

    ## <YYYY-MM-DD> - <trigger or phase>
    What happened: <one line, with the command or file>
    Would-have-caught: <the rule>
    Action: promoted to rule <n> | kept as a note

## Entries

## 2026-10-08 - Phase 3, affected tests (a lock added after docs were synced)
What happened: adding 3 call-site locks to `compositing-ui.test.ts` (34 -> 37 cases) left the count
claims stale, so `bun run test src/lib/editor/__tests__/docs-drift.test.ts` went red on the next run
(README and testing.md said 1045, structure.md 1021, the inventory row 34) while the suite I edited
was itself green.
Would-have-caught: trigger 6 read narrowly ("affected tests" = the suites I edited). Any test-count
change makes the count lock an affected test, and the inventory row plus every repo-wide headline
move with the tests.
Action: promoted to rule 6.

## 2026-10-08 - Phase 3, manual proof (harness assumption)
What happened: `agent-browser mouse down right` delivered button=2 to the page but never fired a
native `contextmenu`, so Radix's track menu never opened and the first proof run asserted against an
absent menu (and `find text "Load sample media"` had clicked the empty-state `<em>` instead of the
button, so no samples imported at all).
Would-have-caught: trigger 7 (proof names the action and the observed result) read as asserting the
ACTION's effect, not only the end state, after each step.
Action: kept as a note (the workaround is dispatching a `contextmenu` event and clicking by role);
no checklist rule needs it.

## 2026-10-10 - plan review (fixing one defect introduced another)
What happened: fixing the "proxy drops preview audio" finding, `PLAN-0.8.0-tier2.md` described the proxy
audio decode as `Input -> getPrimaryAudioTrack() ... the exact pattern mp4.ts:160,505 already uses`.
`mp4.ts` never calls `getPrimaryAudioTrack` (grep is empty); it decodes with `ctx.decodeAudioData` on the
file (`mp4.ts:308`), and `toAudioBuffer()` is on a decoded `AudioSample` (`sample.d.ts:569`), not on an
`InputAudioTrack`. The plan cited a precedent the repo does not have.
Would-have-caught: rule 2 (read before you climb) applied to citations: a "the existing X already does
this" line is a claim about the code, so open X and confirm the exact mechanism before writing it down.
Action: kept as a note. In the plan this became a standing habit: every `file:line` and every
"already does this" is opened before it ships.

## 2026-10-10 - plan claim audit (a "pass" that was hand-counted)
What happened: the plan's Class A audit claimed "pass (37 citations)" but had not opened every line, so
it passed `core.ts:668` where the intended comment sits at `:671` (668 is the `computeGain` signature).
A reviewer's line-by-line pass caught it.
Would-have-caught: rule 7 (proof names the action and the observed result) applied to the audit itself: a
citation check's result is the opened line, not a count of citations.
Action: promoted the wording into the plan's Class A row ("read the named thing on that EXACT line; a
list of line numbers is not a pass until each is opened").

## 2026-10-11 - Feature C source inventory (search root was too narrow)
What happened: the first `project.tracks` inventory searched editor modules and components but omitted
`src/hooks/editor/useEditorKeyboard.ts`, reporting 90 line occurrences in 27 files instead of 92 in 28.
Would-have-caught: rule 4 now requires structural sweeps from the full `src/` root, with test exclusions,
separate line and file counts, and each source location opened.
Action: promoted into rule 4.

## 2026-10-12 - Feature C createCompoundClip depth guard (checked before the edge existed)
What happened: the nesting-depth guard ran `maxSequenceDepth(doc)` after pushing the new sequence but
BEFORE adding the container clip, so the new sequence was unreachable from the root and the walk never
saw the extra edge; a depth-9 compound was accepted. The `compound.test.ts` boundary test caught it.
Would-have-caught: rule 5 (write the lock first and watch it fail) applied to a guard that depends on a
mutation ORDER: the prospective-graph check must run with every edge of the prospective graph present.
Action: kept as a note; the command now adds the container, checks depth, then removes the originals.
